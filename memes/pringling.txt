pringling

About
Pringling refers to a fake fundamental concept of painting invented by Twitter user Danny Sweeney. In a lengthy thread, Sweeney detailed how famous painters employed techniques called "pringling" and "re-pringling," including diagrams illustrating how "pringling" was utilized in paintings such as the Mona Lisa and Starry Night. Others joined in on the hoax, creating fake books and Wikipedia pages about pringling, while other artists demonstrated how to "pringle," confusing those who weren't in on the joke.


Origin
On March 14th, 2021 Twitter user @Dann_Sw[1] began a lengthy thread on the fake fundamental concept of "pringling" in art. The thread never quite defines the exact definition of "pringling," but does say, "Pringling, as we all know, occurs in low to high frequency fields within artworks" and "The Baroque period was rife with anti-pringling sentiment, but artists such as Rembrandt used the common right-angle rule to maintain Pringle-Free zones. As we all know, pringling is distributed based on distance from the prime angle" (example tweets shown below).

   


Spread
In the replies to the thread, multiple users added to the joke by discussing the (fake) academic study of pringling. User @FromHappyRock[2] posted a photoshopped cover of a book about pringling by Andrew Loomis, gaining over 20 retweets and 290 likes (shown below, left). User @John_O_Really[3] posted a fake Wikipedia entry on the concept, gaining over 60 retweets and 760 likes (shown below, right).

  
Others on Twitter joined in on the hoax by demonstrating the "pringling" in their own work. For example, user @jeremypwynn[4] posted a diagram demonstrating "how to pringle," gaining over 260 retweets and 1,100 likes (shown below, left). User @HalleyHanna[5] posted a photograph of a Transformers toy with a "pringling" diagram (shown below, right).
