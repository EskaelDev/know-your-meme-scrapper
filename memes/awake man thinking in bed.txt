awake man thinking in bed

About
Awake Man Thinking in Bed refers to an exploitable image macro based on a webcomic in which a stick figure person lies in bed awake at 2:39 a.m. and thinks about something random. In memes, a thought that keeps the person awake is typically edited into the character's thought cloud. The format was popularized in early 2021, primarily on Twitter.


Origin
On January 28th, 2021, Pinterest[1][2] user @chaotichomie posted two single-panel comics depicting a stick figure person in his bed (shown below, left and right). In one of the comics, the person is shown lying awake at 2:39 a.m. with a thought that going to therapy may cause them to lose their sense of humor, thus keeping them awake.
