On March 2nd, 2020, New York Post tweeted[1] an article about an astronomy student who discovered 17 new planets. On July 19th, 2020, Twitter[2] user @steroberrys quote retweeted the tweet, writing "he needs to discover some bitches." The tweet received over 26,800 retweets and 238,000 likes in nine months (shown below).

 
In the following days, screenshots of the tweet were widely circulated online. For example, on July 29th, 2020, Instagram[3] account memeblox posted a screenshot of the tweet, with the post gaining over 20,500 likes.
The phrase did not see use as a snowclone until October 12th, 2020, when Facebook[4] page Rappers In Peculiar Places posted a meme comparing rapper Young Thug and Christopher Columbus that gained over 6,300 reactions and 9,400 shares (shown below).

 


Spread
In the following week, the meme was widely circulated online, including reposts on Reddit[5] and Instagram.[6]

Following the viral popularity of Among Drip meme in December 2020, the snowclone received strong association with the Among Drip image, and has since typically been used in combination with images in which characters repeated the pose and wore Nike Jordans. On December 22nd, 2020, Instagram[11] user dreadbearfeelsirony posted the earliest derviative meme combining the snowclone and a Five Nights at Freddy's remake of the image (shown below, right).

 

The format maintained significant popularity online in the following months, with multiple viral versions posted on Reddit, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms. Both Among Drip and Goku Drip edits have been used in conjunction with the snowclone.
