About
Beyonc√© Megan Thee Stallion Grammy Win Reaction is a reaction image macro meme featuring the recording artists Beyonc√© and Megan Thee Stallion learning that Beyonc√© had tied the number for the most Grammy Award wins by an artist. In the image, Beyonc√© appears to be shocked, leading many to use it as a reaction image to jokes about shock, disassociation or a lack of concentration.


Origin
On March 14th, 2021, rapper Megan Thee Stallion and singer Beyonc√© accepted the Best Rap Song at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards on stage.[1] That day, the verified Grammys YouTube channel shared the clip, receiving more than 2.7 million views in less than three days (shown below).

Following the win, host Trevor Noah stopped Beyonc√© and Megan Thee Stallion from leaving the stage and informed the audience that Beyonc√©'s win tied her for the most Grammy wins ever. Upon finding out this information, Beyonc√© paused and diverted her eyes downward, appearing shocked. That evening, Twitter user @Rumiyoncee shared the video, which received more than 2.3 million views, 111,000 likes and 19,000 retweets (shown below).
