vtubers shoes

About
Vtuber's Shoes refers to the hashtag "#Vtuberの靴が見たい" with which people post the bottom halves of their VTuber models, as during streams, VTubers are almost exclusively shown from the waist up.


Origin
On March 14th, 2021, Twitter[1] user @Torte_Kamakraya posted a tweet expressing their disappointment Japanese VTuber app IRIAM did not allow them to show their VTuber model's shoes. They then posted a picture of the shoes with the hashtag "#Vtuberの靴が見たい," which roughly “I want to see the shoes of," inviting others to show the bottom halves of their VTuber models. The tweet gained over 20 retweets and 228 likes (shown below).

 


Spread
Over the following several days, multiple VTubers posted pictures of their models' rarely-seen shoes with the hashtag. Examples include tweets by @Monichipon[2] and @shiroganenoel[3], gaining over 700 and 16,000 likes, respectively (shown below).

  
Some made jokes about how many VTubers are specifically "half-body" Vtubers, meaning their bottom halves were never modeled. For example, user @saitiwi_[4] posted a plain green screen meant to represent "half-body" VTubers participating in the trend, gaining over 190 retweets and 3,100 likes (shown below, left). User @ywuria[5] posted a picture of their half-body model with stick figure legs, gaining over 210 likes (shown below, right). The trend was covered by Polygon.[6]
