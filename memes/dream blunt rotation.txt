Origin
The phrase "dream blunt rotation" likely predates its Internet usage. However, on February 29th, 2012, Twitter [1] user @camplothe posted the earliest mention of the phrase, "add @camplo and @OfficialCampLo to my dream blunt rotation Bamboo bungalow" (shown below).

 
More than eight years later, on September 12th, 2020, Twitter[2] user @vmpkid posted the earliest available version with pictures, including photos of Markiplier, Julia Vaugh from the series Euphoria (portrayed by Hunter Schafe) and more (shown below).

The meme format re-emerged in January 2021 as a prompt for other Twitter users. On January 24th, 2021, Twitter[3] user @SheaCoulee tweeted, "You can only pick four people to be in the blunt rotation. Who are they?" They included pictures of Snoop Dogg, Rihanna, Alison Janey and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (shown below, left). The tweet received more than 5,800 likes and 600 retweets (shown below, left).

The first, published by Twitter[4] @pumpkabooo on March 11th, 2021, features the characters from the web series Don't Hug Me I'm Scared. The post received more than 137,000 likes and 22,000 retweets (shown below, center).
