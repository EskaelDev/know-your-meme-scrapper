awkward party reaction

About
Awkward Party Reaction refers to a photograph of a group of partygoers, predominantly women, who are looking at the camera with confused and perturbed expressions. It is visually similar to reaction memes such as Girls Looking Back In Class, though this picture has is usually used in memes as a reaction image paired with captions implying self-deprecation or other awkward moments.


Origin
On November 12th, 2012, YouTuber LifeAccordingToJimmy posted a video titled "Don't Stop the Music," a skit based on the awkward moments caused when the music stops at a party and a story one is telling is overheard by others. In the sketch, the music stops as the main character says something particularly strange, causing the partygoers to stare at him. The video gained over 4.2 million views (shown below).



Spread
The clip of the party staring awkwardly did not start seeing use as a meme until a year later. On October 21st, 2013, a still image of the party reaction shot (shown below, left) appeared in a photo dump on Dutch site VKmag.[1] On December 30th, 2013, the picture was posted to /r/funny[2] by user kencrema with the caption, "The look you get when you ask Americans why they always use red plastic cups to drink," gaining over 960 points (shown below, right).

  
The meme saw consistent use as a reaction image over the following years, and continues seeing consistent use as of March 2021. Recent popular examples include a November 22nd, 2020 post by Twitter [3] user @notjacksafford regarding mask-wearing in the American south, gaining over 39,000 retweets and 423,000 likes (shown below, left).
