About
Now Look at This is a TikTok trend based on an edited version of the 2008 song "Day 'n' Nite" by rapper Kid Cudi. Videos start with the lyric "Now look at this" and cut off to an unrelated video, which is usually amusing in some way. The trend was popularized on the platform in early 2021.


Origin
On February 5th, 2008, American rapper Kid Cudi released "Day 'n' Nite" as the first single from his debut mixtape A Kid Named Cudi (music video shown below).[1]


Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
