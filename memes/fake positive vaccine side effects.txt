fake positive vaccine side effects

About
Fake Positive Vaccine Side Effects refers to satirical claims that the COVID-19 vaccine has given people unexpectedly pleasant benefits in addition to being protected from Covid. These are often cosmetic side effects, such as more attractive genitalia. The posts are parodies of conspiracy theory claims that the vaccine will cause negative side effects, such as implanted microchips.


Origin
While it's unclear when postive vaccine side effects parody posts started, it appears they began in late 2020, as news of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout began. One of the earliest known posts was posted by Twitter[1] user @MrFantasticle on December 9th, 2020. The post reads:

Calling upon everyone who gets vaccinated to make up stories like these and post them on facebook:
"The vaccine made my dick grow by 5 inches!"
"The vaccine has increased my sex appeal significantly!"
"The vaccine finally allowed me to grow a beard."
