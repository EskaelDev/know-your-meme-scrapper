get real

Get real memes are often times portrayed as short, sped up gifs, with a caption get real. They are shitposts. The origin of the meme is unknown, but its attributed to Discord and Tenor in the year 2020.


The memes discord-wide usage started in the late 2020, and it migrated to YouTube in late 2020/early 2021. Unlike discord, the YouTube versions often times have ost from rythm heaven in the background
