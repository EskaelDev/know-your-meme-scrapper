tally hall trollface edits

About
Tally Hall Trollface Edits refers to a series of videos set to music by American rock band Tally Hall (and offshoots such as Miracle Musical, Rob Cantor, and Joe Hawley) consisting of Trollface and other elements of Rage Comics, often with a surreal or satirical bend.


Origin
On January 23rd, 2021, Redditor vinland posted a Trollface version of Ruler of Everything to the /r/okbuddyretard subreddit,[1] gaining over 16,700 upvotes in two weeks. (YouTube reupload shown below.)

Spread
The trend became unique as more songs were covered. YouTube user Chase Hukill uploaded a full version of "Ruler of Everything" (composed of original work, vinland's video, and content by YouTube user McJimbles[2]).

Later, YouTube user "Mantis Orientalis" uploaded a similar edit for the song "Misery Fell".
