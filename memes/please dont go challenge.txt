please dont go challenge

About
The Please Don't Go Challenge is a TikTok transformational video trend. The videos consist of two shots. In the first shot, the participants lip-sync to the song "Please Don't Go" by Mike Posner while sitting in the car. As they reach the lyrics reach the titular lines, the video cuts to another shot of the participants wearing headscarves and sunglasses, indicating that they left the relationship.


Origin
On June 9th, 2010, American recording artist Mike Posner released the song "Please Don't Go."[1] Later that year, on October 15th, Posner published a video for the song on YouTube, which received more than 51 million views in less than 11 years (shown below).

In 2020, the song became associated with a TikTok trend that acted out the lyrics to the song from the perspective of the person being sung to. In the song, Posner pleads with an unnamed person to not leave him, presumably, meaning that he wants to remain in a romantic partnership. The videos, however, play on wardrobe signifiers associated with someone running away. The most recognizable comparison would be the characters in the 1991 film Thelma & Louise,[2] which follows two fugitive women after they escape their romantic relationships. One of the characters, Louise (portrayed by Susan Sarandon), wears a headscarf and sunglasses (shown below). Once the participant reaches the lyrics "please don't go," the video cuts to a shot of the participants dressed like Louise.
