Origin
The absurd meme comes from a youtube video called "top ten spongebob funny faces.wmv"[1]
Spread
The video and accompanying image blew up in 2020 when it was seen as an ironic shitpost despite the fact that the original was made with sincerity. The meme "sigbeqboibe" of mispelling spongebob with funny text also derives from this image. 
On January 18th, 2020, Twitter user @quagmire_toilet posted this tweet sharing the screencap from the video with a bizzare caption of faux-english mixed with emojis. Reddit user u/Blizzk shared the image on r/okbuddyretard January 27th where it recieved 200 upvotes.
The meme is often referenced with Chills or other countdown channel memes due to its nature as part of a countdown. It has also been visually and auditorily edited in the fashion of "Steamed Hams" or Ear-rape/Vocoded memes.
