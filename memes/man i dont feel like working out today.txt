About
Man, I Don't Feel Like Working Out Today, also known as Yeeaahhh Mothafucker, refers to a series of memes based on a Rage Comic in which a man finds motivation to lift weights. Originally circulated on the /fit/ board of 4chan, the comic gained notable spread online in 2020.


Origin
On June 14th, 2014, an unknown 4chan user archived an image file named "motivation.jpg" on a side server.[1] The image, a four-panel Rage Comic, depicts a man considering not working out on a certain day and then gets motivated to lifts weights after seeing an image of an obese woman (shown below). It is unconfirmed whether this version of the comic is the original.

 
On May 20th, 2016, an anonymous 4chan[2] user made the earliest found post containing the image in a /fit/ thread.


Spread
Between May 2016 and December 2019, the image was posted in 46 threads on the /fit/ board of 4chan.[3] On July 20th, 2018, an anonymous user posted the earliest found derivative image in a /fit/ thread, with the image of the woman replaced with an image of a skinny man (shown below, left).
On July 29th, 2019, iFunny[4] user Persian posted the earliest found edit of the image posed outside of 4chan, an ironic Big Chungus meme that gained 30 smiles in two years (shown below, center). On November 23rd, 2019, iFunny[5] user Liitty then posted a version of the meme featuring fan art of Filia from Skullgirls that received 44 smiles and was circulated[6] online in the following days.

   
On April 7th, 2020, an unknown Redditor[7] posted an Isabelle version of the meme with the face of another Redditor edited in the /r/cringetopia subreddit, claiming that the Redditor made it himself and posted it on his Discord server, with the Redditor[8] denying the allegations in the comments of the post. The post received over 17,100 upvotes in six months (shown below). An April 8th, 2020, repost in the /r/okbuddyretard[9] subreddit received over 5,000 upvotes prior to being removed.

 
On April 24th, 2020, Instagram[10] user need.if posted a video edit of the meme that received over 78,000 views and 19,000 likes in one year (shown below). On May 18th, 2020, an anonymous 4chan[11] user opened a /fit/ thread about workout motivation, posting a Misaka Mikoto version of the meme. In the thread, several users responded with self-made versions.

The format did not see major spread until August 15th, 2020, when iFunny[12] user Escharum posted a Transformers version of the meme that received over 5,800 smiles in eight months (shown below, left). In the following months, iFunny users then posted video edits featuring soundtracks from various games (examples shown below, center and right), with a number of examples being featured[13][14] on the app and spreading to other platforms.

  

On December 11th and 19th, 2020, Instagram[15][16] users idieasvirgin and scar.nyb posted dubbed versions of the meme that gained over 47,000 and 5,900 views in three months, respectively (shown below, left and right).
